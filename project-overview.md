# Madarson K8s DevOps Suite - Project Overview

## Vision

The Madarson K8s DevOps Suite provides a comprehensive, production-ready observability and security platform for Kubernetes environments. Our goal is to simplify the deployment and management of essential DevOps tools while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability and security.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**: Time-series metrics database with PromQL query language
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and management
- **Kube-State-Metrics**: Kubernetes object state metrics
- **Node Exporter**: Hardware and OS-level metrics

#### Visualization
- **Grafana**: Unified dashboard for metrics and logs
- Pre-configured dashboards for common use cases
- Multi-datasource support (Prometheus, Loki)

#### Logging Stack
- **Loki**: Log aggregation system optimized for Kubernetes
- **Promtail**: Log collection agent (DaemonSet)
- LogQL query language for log exploration

#### Security
- **Falco**: Runtime security and threat detection
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- Custom security rules for Kubernetes environments

### Design Principles

1. **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested configurations with sensible defaults
2. **Easy Deployment**: One-click deployment via Azure Marketplace or simple Helm install
3. **Comprehensive**: All essential tools in a single package
4. **Secure by Default**: Security best practices built-in
5. **Scalable**: Supports small dev clusters to large production environments

## Technical Stack

- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes 1.24+
- **Package Management**: Helm 3
- **Cloud Platform**: Azure (primary), cloud-agnostic design
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes with configurable storage classes
- **Networking**: Standard Kubernetes networking with optional ingress

## Target Users

- **DevOps Engineers**: Needing comprehensive monitoring for Kubernetes
- **Platform Teams**: Building internal developer platforms
- **Security Teams**: Requiring runtime security and compliance
- **SREs**: Managing production Kubernetes clusters

## Use Cases

### Development Environments
- Quick setup for dev/test clusters
- Resource-efficient configuration
- Rapid troubleshooting with centralized logs

### Staging Environments
- Production-like monitoring setup
- Pre-production testing and validation
- Performance benchmarking

### Production Environments
- High-availability configuration
- Long-term metrics retention
- Enterprise security and compliance
- Alert routing to on-call teams

## Deployment Models

### Azure Marketplace
- Managed deployment through Azure Portal

- Multi-cloud capable

## Configuration Philosophy

### Layered Configuration
1. **Defaults**: Production-ready out-of-box
2. **Environment Profiles**: Dev, staging, production presets
3. **Custom Values**: Fine-grained control for specific needs

### Storage Strategy
- Separate PVCs for each component
- Configurable retention periods
- Storage class flexibility (Azure Disk, Azure Files, etc.)

### Security Model
- RBAC-enabled by default
- Network policies available
- Pod security policies supported
- Secrets management via Kubernetes secrets

## Performance Characteristics

### Resource Requirements (Basic Setup)
- **CPU**: ~2 vCPUs
- **Memory**: ~6GB
- **Storage**: ~100GB
- **Nodes**: 3+ recommended

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
- DaemonSet deployment for Promtail, Falco, Node Exporter
- Supports clusters from 3 to 1000+ nodes

## Monitoring Capabilities
