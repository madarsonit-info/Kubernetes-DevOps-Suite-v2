# Best Practices

## Deployment Best Practices

### 1. Resource Planning
- Size appropriately for your cluster
- Monitor resource usage over time
- Plan for growth (30% headroom recommended)

### 2. Storage
- Use premium storage for production
- Configure appropriate retention periods
- Monitor disk usage regularly
- Set up automated backups

### 3. High Availability
- Deploy across multiple availability zones
- Use pod anti-affinity rules
- Configure replica counts appropriately
- Test failover scenarios

## Configuration Best Practices

### 1. Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets to git
- Use Kubernetes secrets or external secret managers
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Limit secret access via RBAC

### 2. Resource Limits
- Always set resource requests and limits
- Monitor for OOMKilled pods
- Adjust based on actual usage
- Use VPA for automatic recommendations

### 3. Networking
- Use network policies in production
- Limit external access
- Use ingress with TLS
- Configure firewall rules

## Monitoring Best Practices

### 1. Metrics
- Monitor your monitoring stack itself
- Set up alerts for component failures
- Track metrics cardinality
- Use recording rules for expensive queries

### 2. Dashboards
- Organize dashboards by team/service
- Use variables for flexibility
- Keep dashboards focused
- Document custom dashboards

### 3. Alerting
- Start with critical alerts only
- Avoid alert fatigue
- Set appropriate thresholds
- Document alert runbooks

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Runtime Security
- Review Falco rules regularly
- Tune rules to reduce false positives
- Integrate with incident response
- Test security policies

### 2. Vulnerability Management
- Run Trivy scans regularly
- Prioritize critical vulnerabilities
- Track remediation progress
- Integrate with CI/CD

### 3. Access Control
- Use RBAC least privilege principle
- Regular access audits
- MFA for admin access
- Audit log monitoring

## Operational Best Practices

### 1. Updates and Maintenance
- Test updates in non-production first
- Maintain a rollback plan
- Review changelogs before upgrading
- Schedule maintenance windows

### 2. Backup and Recovery
- Regular backup schedule
- Test restore procedures
- Document recovery steps
- Store backups off-cluster

### 3. Documentation
- Keep runbooks updated
- Document custom configurations
- Maintain architecture diagrams
- Track configuration changes

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Query Optimization
- Use recording rules
- Optimize PromQL queries
- Cache frequently used queries
- Limit query time ranges

### 2. Storage Optimization
- Tune retention periods
- Use compression
- Monitor IOPS usage
- Consider tiered storage

### 3. Scalability
- Monitor growth trends
- Scale proactively
- Use horizontal scaling
- Load test before production
